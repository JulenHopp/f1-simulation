# F1 Simulation

## Description
The F1 Simulation project is a MATLAB application designed for motorsport enthusiasts and engineers. It allows users to input coordinates to generate a graphical representation of an F1 track. Additionally, users can input parameters such as vehicle speed, weight, and other dynamics to simulate whether the car can successfully navigate the track's curves or not.

## Features
- Graphical track generation from user-provided coordinates.
- Simulation of vehicle dynamics including speed, weight, and other factors.
- Analysis of whether a car can successfully navigate the track based on input parameters.

## Technologies Used
- MATLAB

## Installation and Setup
To run this simulation, MATLAB is required.

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/julenHopp/f1-simulation.git
2. Open the project files in MATLAB.

## Usage
- Input the desired coordinates for the track layout.
- Set the vehicle parameters like speed and weight.
- Run the simulation to see the graphical representation of the track and analyze the vehicle's performance on the track.

## Contributing
Contributions to enhance the simulation, add new features, or improve the user experience are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
